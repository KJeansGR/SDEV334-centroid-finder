     * RR is the red component, GG is the green component, and BB is the blue component,
     * each ranging from 0 to 255.
     * 
     * The Euclidean color distance is calculated by treating each color as a point
     * in 3D space (red, green, blue) and applying the Euclidean distance formula:
     * 
     * sqrt((r1 - r2)^2 + (g1 - g2)^2 + (b1 - b2)^2)
     * 
     * This gives a measure of how visually different the two colors are.

            Base 10: (3 X 10)+(4 X 1) = 34  
            Base 16: (3 X 16)+(4 X 1) = 52  ---> >> 16 ---> 00110100  

            0xFF is 8 1's in binary --> 1111111 so an "&" flips all bits to zero that arent the first 8 bits
            this isolates the value we want in the greens place in this example because shifting the green still 
            leaves the remaining red/greater bits
